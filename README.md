Planit Testing – Online Automation Assessment Invitation


1. What other possible scenario’s would you suggest for testing the Jupiter Toys application?
	Possible test scenarios:
		a. Login Functionality
		b. Checkout Functionality
		c. Remove Item from Cart's item list
		d. Empty Cart functionality


2. Jupiter Toys is expected to grow and expand its offering into books, tech, and modern art. 
We are expecting the of tests will grow to a very large number.
	What approaches could you used to reduce overall execution time?
		One of the approaches that I have in mind is to do a parallel execution. As a QA, doing this can achieve maximum coverage of the tests with reduced execution time. 
	How will your framework cater for this?
		Selenium does have the Selenium Grid. This lets the user distribute tests on multiple machines and run all of them at the same time.

3. Describe when to use a BDD approach to automation and when NOT to use BDD 
		>The best opportunity to use BDD for automation is when an organization is shifting from the Waterfall to Agile or when a team is currently in Agile. As test cases are written in simple text, it will be easier across the board to understand them. 
		>Not to use BDD when the organization fails to apply the BDD's application which is collaborating across the board (PO, Developers, BAs, QAs), as it will only bring more difficulty to the QA team.
